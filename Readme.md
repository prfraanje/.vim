VIM
---

Vim is my favorite editor. I learned the basics during an internship at Leuven
Measurement Systems (now part of Siemens), Leuven, Belgium, among which: ESC for normal mode, 
i for insert mode and v for visual mode as well as some basic editing commands
like y (copy/yank), x (delete), o (newline below), O (newline above), p (paste after), P (paste before) and w (write) and q (quit).
In the beginning its a bit hard to work with vim, but it pays off. I like its
power,  configurability and speed. If you want to learn more about vim, have a
look at http://www.openvim.com. Vim is charity ware, also have a look at

- In most Linux distributions Vim can be installed from the package manager.
